   ![Langflow](assets/langflow-flow-settings-1.png)

> **üéâ Success!** Your flow is now set up and ready for development. Next, we‚Äôll create a simple echo flow to see how components interact.  

--- 

### Step 2: **Create a Simple Echo Flow** üîÅüí¨

To understand the basics of Langflow, let‚Äôs create a simple flow where the input is echoed back to the user. This will help us get familiar with the interface and how components interact.

1. **Add Components:** üß©  
   - Drag `Chat Input` and `Chat Output` components from the left-hand panel onto the canvas.  
   - These components represent the user input and the system response, respectively.

2. **Connect the Components:** üîó  
   - Link the `Chat Input` component to the `Chat Output` component.  
   - This creates a direct flow where user input is sent directly to the output.

   ![Langflow](assets/langflow-echo-flow.png)

3. **Test in the Playground:** üéÆ  
   - Click the **Playground** button to test the flow.  
   - In the Playground, type:  
     ```
     hello
     ```  
   - Observe how the input is echoed back in the output.

   ![Langflow](assets/langflow-playground-echo.png)

> **üéâ Success!** You‚Äôve created your first flow in Langflow. This simple echo flow demonstrates how components can interact. Next, let‚Äôs extend this flow by introducing an agent to handle more complex tasks.

---

### Step 3: **Extend the Flow with an Agent** ü§ñüí°

To enable more advanced capabilities, we will extend the flow by integrating an agent. This agent will serve as the brain behind our application, processing inputs and interacting with tools.

1. **Remove Existing Connections:** ‚úÇÔ∏è  
   - Disconnect the `Chat Input` and `Chat Output` components.

2. **Add an Agent Component:** üß©  
   - Drag and drop the `Agent` component onto the canvas.  

3. **Connect the Components:** üîó  
   - Link the `Chat Input` component to the `Agent` component.  
   - Connect the `Agent` component to the `Chat Output` component.  

   ![Langflow](assets/langflow-agentic-flow.png)

4. **Configure API Credentials:** üîë  
   - The agent supports various LLM providers. For this workshop, we use OpenAI, which requires an API key.  
   - Click the icon in the **OpenAI API Key** field of the agent.  
   - Add a new variable of type **Credential**, name it `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and select the variable.  

   ![Langflow](assets/langflow-credential.png)

5. **Set Agent Instructions:** üìú  
   - Instructions provide the agent with guidance on what tasks to perform and how to interact with tools.  
   - Click the icon in the **Agent Instructions** field to view the default instruction:  
     ```
     You are a helpful assistant that can use tools to answer questions and perform tasks.
     ```  
   - For now, we will leave this default instruction unchanged.

6. **Test the Flow in the Playground:** üéÆ  
   - Open the **Playground**, enter a query like:  
     ```
     Who is Bob Marley?
     ```  
   - Observe the agent's response and verify that it processes the input correctly.  

   ![Langflow](assets/langflow-playground-bob-marley.png)


> **üéâ Success!** You‚Äôve successfully integrated an agent into your flow. This marks a significant step toward creating a smart and interactive application. Next, let‚Äôs tailor the agent for our specific use case: the "Customer Support Agent."  

---

### Step 4: **Implement the RAG Flow** üîçüìö

The agent we developed so far cannot answer questions specific to our context and may hallucinate, producing irrelevant or incorrect responses. To address this, we‚Äôll implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) flow. This approach allows the agent to retrieve relevant data from the company‚Äôs FAQ database for accurate responses.

1. **Add an Astra DB Component:** üóÑÔ∏è  
   - Drag an `Astra DB` component onto the canvas from the **Vector Stores** section.  
   - This component will store and retrieve vectorized FAQ data.

2. **Add a Retriever Tool:** üõ†Ô∏è  
   - Drag a `RetrieverTool` component onto the canvas from the **Tools** section.  
   - This tool will enable the agent to search the FAQ database for relevant information.

3. **Connect the Components:** üîó  
   - Link the `Retriever` output of the `Astra DB` component to the `Retriever` input of the `RetrieverTool` component.  
   - Connect the `Tools` output of the `RetrieverTool` component to the `Agent` component.

   ![Langflow](assets/langflow-rag-flow.png)

4. **Create a New Database in Astra DB:** üìã  
   - In the `Astra DB` component, click **Add New Database** to create a new database.  
 
   ![Langflow](assets/langflow-create-database.png)

      ```
      What are the shipping times?
      ```
    - Observe the response and confirm the agent uses the `RetrieverTool` effectively.

    ![Langflow](assets/langflow-playground-faq-flow-not-working.png)

12. **Verify the Flow:** ‚úÖ  
    - **Test Point 1:** Observe that the agent is unable to respond meaningfully without context.

> **üéâ Success!** Your agent now includes a RAG flow to answer context-specific queries accurately. The foundation is laid‚Äînext, we‚Äôll enrich the agent with the required FAQ data. Say goodbye to hallucinations and hello to reliable responses!  

---

### Step 5: **Vectorize the FAQ** üìö‚ú®

The agent cannot yet provide proper answers because it lacks the necessary information from the FAQ. Although we have an FAQ collection in the database, it is currently empty. Let‚Äôs populate it using a vectorization flow in Langflow.

---

1. **Add a File Component:** üìÇ
   - Drag a `File` component onto the canvas from the **Data** section.
   - This will allow you to upload the `Company_FAQ.pdf`.

       ```text
       You are an expert in analyzing customer orders and providing detailed and accurate information. Your primary role is to utilize the provided tools to efficiently look up order numbers, retrieve relevant details about the orders, and address any questions or concerns the user may have. Always aim to deliver clear, concise, and helpful responses, ensuring the user's needs are fully met.

       Lookup order numbers and product IDs using the tools provided.

       Orders always contain an array of product IDs. Use these IDs to look up the specific products from the product lookup tool and aggregate the product information with the order to provide a clear summary of the order.

       If the order does not exist, simply tell the user to try again as the ID wasn't found.

       Only return information about orders; do not return anything else.
       ```

   - Enable **Tool Mode** and provide meaningful labels:
     - Rename the component to `OrderLookupAgent`.

   ![Langflow](assets/langflow-agent-tool-mode.png)

     ```text
     You are a skilled customer service manager and information router. Your primary responsibility is to use the available tools to accurately address user inquiries and provide detailed, helpful responses. You can:

     - Look up order numbers to retrieve and share order details.
     - Access product information to provide relevant descriptions or specifications.
     - Answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) about shipping, returns, placing orders, and more.

     If a query requires multiple tools, combine their outputs to deliver a comprehensive response. 
     Example: For an inquiry about canceling an order, retrieve the order and product details, and also reference the FAQ for the cancellation policy.

     Always aim to deliver clear, concise, and user-focused solutions to ensure the best possible experience.
     ```

3. **Connect the Tools to ManagementAgent:** üîó
   - Link the `OrderLookupAgent` component‚Äôs `Toolset` endpoint to the `ManagementAgent` component‚Äôs `Tools` endpoint.

     ![Langflow](assets/langflow-complete-flow.png)
